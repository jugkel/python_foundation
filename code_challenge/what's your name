Challenge - What is your name
Background and Objectives
Validate once more your understanding of methods and variables.
Learn how to use String interpolation and String methods
Specs

Compute name
Implement a compute_name function line 2. Given the first_name, middle_name, and last_name, it should return the full name of the person.
constraint: You must use string interpolation with f"{}" to build this full name.
Key learning points
Again, ask yourself these questions and make sure you can answer all of them:

on variables

What are the variables in your code?
Where do you assign values to these variables and where do you use them?
What’s the scope of a variable?
on functions

What is the function of your program? Where do you define it?
Where do you call this method and with which arguments?
What’s the flow of your program when you try to read it line by line?
on strings

What’s string interpolation? What’s the syntax to “insert” some python expression in a string?
